# **RecallRight v2**
## **Overview**
The aim is to develop a scalable **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that acts as a comprehensive knowledge repository.

## **Core Features**
### **1. Data Sources**
- Support for **websites** and **PDFs** initially.
- Ability to **parse images and tables** from data sources for extracting structured information.

### **2. Enhanced Summarization**
- **Topic + Description-based Summarization** for concise, meaningful insights from the data.
- Better results for better descriptions - *should provide examples for ease of use as this will be a resource intensive functionality*.

### **3. Full-Stack Application**
- **User Authentication**:
  - Secure login and token-based system with limited **query tokens** for summarization.
- **Folder-Based Organization**:
  - Allow users to create folders to group documents they think are relevant to specific topics.
- **Data Input**:
  - A user-friendly interface to upload, manage, and organize data sources.

### **4. Search-with-Context**
- Provide **in-place results** with context for searched terms.
- Ideally a **Chrome Extension** (?)



## **Key Objectives**
- **Scalability**:
  - Efficient handling of large datasets and increasing user base.
- **Usability**:
  - Intuitive interface for adding, organizing, and querying data.
- **Contextual Accuracy**:
  - Deliver precise, context-aware responses leveraging advanced summarization and search mechanisms.
- **Integration Flexibility**:
  - Support diverse content types (text, images, tables) with room for future enhancements like video processing.
 
## **Future enhancement ideas**
- A desktop application so that users can run this application on top of their already organised folders.
- Custom article writer for users(similar to description for summarization)
