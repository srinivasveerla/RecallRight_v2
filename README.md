Plan is to create a large scale RAG system to act like a knowledge reporitory.
- Should support websites and pdfs to start with
- Should be able to parse images and tables for the data sources
- A topic+description based summarization
- A full stack application to enable users add data.
    - Autharization and limited "query tokens" to let users get summarizations
    - folders to let users add specific docs they think are relevant to the folder
- A easy to use search-with-context which will give inplace results to searches about words (chrome extension)
